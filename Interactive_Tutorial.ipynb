If you have any questions, you can discuss them here*', \" ~\\u202fMichael Wall: *1.Inflation. Inflation is a phenomenon of currency depreciation and price increase caused by the supply of money exceeding the amount of money needed for the circulation of goods. When inflation occurs in a country, the cost of its goods must increase, the price of export goods expressed in foreign currency must rise, and the competitiveness of that good in the international market is weakened. If the country's price increase rate exceeds that of other countries, it becomes difficult for the government to maintain normal exports without adjusting the exchange rate, so inflation eventually leads to currency depreciation and causes exchange rate fluctuations. It is important to note that the inflation rate also affects the difference between domestic and foreign real interest rates, which in turn affects the capital account of the balance of payments. A high inflation rate will inevitably cause capital outflows, which will also affect the market's expectations of future prices and exchange rates, which in turn will have an impact on exchange rate movements.*\", ' ~\\u202fBob Stone: Our country is in a period of high inflation right now. Life has become tough.', ' ~\\u202fTheodoric Nguyen: When the dollar goes up, the corresponding product goes down, right?', \" ~\\u202fAnthony Campbell: I think so, I'm investing in XAU/USD.\", ' ~\\u202fMichael Wall: *2.Investment market conditions are usually the most intuitive.

Changes in interest rates not only affect deposit returns, but also change the cost of borrowing, which affects individuals, businesses and governments. Interest rate fluctuations affect international exchange rates*', '', \"*Usually we can focus on the news of the Fed. For example: Federal Reserve interest rate resolutions, Federal Reserve officials' speeches. Powell also made some remarks today. Later I will teach you how to analyze these.*\", ' ~\\u202fBernie Mitchell: Got it', \" ~\\u202fMichael Wall: *4.Psychology of market expectations. Market expectations psychological factors play a considerable role in the movement of the exchange rate, because people on a country's economic situation, income and expenditure, inflation, interest rate prospects, etc., will cause the country's currency to buy a lot, resulting in the exchange rate rise; the opposite bearish, the exchange rate will fall. This psychological expectations and accompanied by a variety of speculative factors, even a rumor, a leader's speech, will cause speculative activities, and may set off a furor in the foreign exchange market, resulting in the rise and fall of the exchange rate.*\", ' ~\\u202fMichael Wall: *These are the news that you need to pay attention to in order to analyze the price of the dollar.
